# HolyQuest
This project is a Mud Server written in Swift, except for the socket code which is written in C.

Sockets
-------
The socket code started as code copied from a contribution by Akshat Sinha on the GeeksforGeeks website.
Much work has done to:
1) Create simple interfaces between the Swift code and the C code
2) Move as much of the code as possible out of C and into Swift
